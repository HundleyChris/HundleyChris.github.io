                <center><h1>Our topic is on the Attack on Normandy beach otherwise known as D-day. This event occured during WW2 when Hitler gained power over germany.</h1></center>
            </div>
            <center><p2>The attack on normandy beach was carried out by us soldiers on June 6, 1944. The americans and British invaded the beaches of Normandy,France where German soldiers were fortified on the beach called the Atlantic Wall. </p2></center>
            <h4>Context</h4>
                <p7>    Much time before the initial invasion of the northern beaches of france the U.S. and Britain collected a surplus of information to assist them in their attack. This included the creation and execution of the Double cross system or the XX community. This System was created by Juan Garcia or “Garbo” who was the leader of this operation, Garbo disguised himself as a German spy that worked for Germany and was awarded by Germany for his “efforts”. Garbo fed Germany false information to the Nazis and collected vital information that was necessary for the invasion.</p7>
                <br/>
                <p8>    Before the attack Britain was thinking of a way to have Germany looking the opposite direction when they invaded, but it almost seemed impossible to do this with the current technology of the Nazis. However it was and how they did it was quite simple. They accomplished this by creating an army of men, airplanes, and tanks in Switzerland, or that’s what they wanted Germany to think, what they actually did was create an entirely fake army of wooden dummies, wooden aircrafts and inflatable tanks to create the illusion of a real army that was really never there. To push it even farther they broadcasted a live video of this fake army replacing the fake men with real ones with the intent of mass deception on Germany.</p8>
            <h3>Triumph</h3>
                <p3>Although the mass amount of losses suffered by the U.S. and Britain the invasion was successful enough to show that the U.S. was there to stay in Normandy. The U.S. during the first wave of soldiers coming in on amphibious vehicles from the ocean onto the beach by surprise was massively discombobulated by the stormy weather and choppy waters. However this did not just include the ships this also included the paratroopers who were off schedule or just missed their target.  Many ships landed on non designated locations and many paratroopers were either shot down by Germans or broke their legs on impact due to the lateness of their deployment of their parachute, but not all attacks missed completely, but a sure amount did actually make it to the beach side to soon be pinned down by the machine guns of the fort. Many soldiers pinned down with the little cover provided by the beach side and sand called for reinforcements which were soonly deployed. Additionally Paratroopers were the sole reason the fort was able to be seized, since the front line was pinned down by the machine gunners the paratroopers dropped in on top of them to take out the gunners so the front line could move up to provide additional support.</p3>
            <h4>Tragedy</h4>
                <p4>During the events of D-Day many thousands of men died. As people would push up the beaches they were to be either shot down by german soldiers using guns such as M1 Thompson, M1918 BAR, etc or the were killed to mines in the sand or barbed wire. This would lead to the death of 125,847 U.S. ground soldiers, 16,714 allied air force deaths.</p4>
            <h5>The Fifth Ranger Infantry Battalion</h5>
                <p5>The fifth Ranger Infantry Battalion was activated on September 1, 1943 under provision of an Army Ground Forces letter, which included in part the following directive:</p5>
                <p6>“All personnel will be chosen from volunteers of above normal mental and physical condition. Personnel should be under 28 Years of age and should meet all physical requirements for that of a parachutist, excepting that he may not be required to jump from an airplane in flight.”</p5>
