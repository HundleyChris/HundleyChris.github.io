                <center><h1>Our topic is on the Attack on Normandy beach otherwise known as D-day. This event occured during WW2 when Hitler gained power over germany.</h1></center>
            </div>
            <p2>The attack on normandy beach was carried out by us soldiers on June 6, 1944. The americans and British invaded the beaches of Normandy,France where German soldiers were fortified on the beach called the Atlantic Wall. </p2>
            <h3>Triumph</h3>
                <p3>When the Allied soldiers arrived at the beach many were shot down as they stepped off the beach. Altho the great loss we eventually made it up to beach in a few days of hard pushing to swiftly take out the German soldiers. This break in the German defenses allowed us to push up into france were Germany had power.</p3>
            <h4>Tragedy</h4>
                <p4>During the events of D-Day many thousands of men died. As people would push up the beaches they were to be either shot down by german soldiers using guns such as M1 Thompson, M1918 BAR, etc or the were killed to mines in the sand or barbed wire. This would lead to the death of 125,847 U.S. ground soldiers, 16,714 allied air force deaths.</p4>
